9.a)Write shell script that takes a login name as command â€“ line argument and
reports when that person logs in.

[20A91A05D7@Linux ~]$ vi 9.a.sh

program:

if [ $# -ne 1 ]
then
        echo Give login name as command line argument
        exit
fi
n=`who|wc -l`
for((i=l;i<=$n;i++))
do
tuser=`who|tr -s " "|head -$i|tail -1|cut -d " " -f1`
if [ "$tuser" = "$1" ]
then
tm=`who|tr -s " "|head -1|cut -d " " -f4`
echo "$1 has logged at $tm"
fi

check whether the two file contents are same or not. If they are same then
second file should be deleted.

read f2
`cmp $f1 $f2>equal`
if [ ! -s equal ]
then
echo files are equal
rm $f2
echo removed $f2
else
echo files are not equal
fi



output:


[20A91A05D7@Linux ~]$ cat ramu
hi
hello
i am ramu
[20A91A05D7@Linux ~]$ cp ramu krishna
[20A91A05D7@Linux ~]$ cat krishna

[20A91A05D7@Linux ~]$ sh 9.b.sh
