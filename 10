10. Write a C program that takes one or more file or directory names as a
command line input and reports the following information on the file:
i) File type.
ii) Number of links.
iii) Read, write and execute permissions.
iv) Time of last access (Note : Use stat/fstat system calls).

program:

#include<stdio.h>
#include<unistd.h>
#include<sys/stat.h>
#include<sys/types.h>
#include<fcntl.h>
void main()
{
 int fd;
struct stat buf;
fd=open("12.sh",O_RDONLY|O_CREAT,600);
if(fd!=-1)
{
 if(fstat(fd,&buf)==0)
{
printf("mode of file is %u",buf.st_mode);
printf("\n size of the file is %u",buf.st_size);
printf("\n device name %u",buf.st_dev);
printf("\n inode of file is %u",buf.st_ino);
printf("\n no.of links are %u",buf.st_nlink);
printf("\n owner of a file is %u",buf.st_uid);
printf("\n no.of blocks is %u",buf.st_blocks);
printf("\n group owner is %u",buf.st_gid);
printf("\n blocks size of the file is %u",buf.st_blksize);
printf("\n time of last modified is %u",buf.st_ctime);
}
else
printf("error in fstat() syscall");
}
else
printf("error in open() sys call");
}

output:

[20A91A05D7@Linux ~]$ cc 10.c
[20A91A05D7@Linux ~]$ ./a.out
mode of file is 33204

 no.of links are 1
 owner of a file is 9393
